- **Consistency**: Please format and comment your code in the same style it has been written until now. In a nutshell,
                   do not be afraid to use blank lines to separate logical sections of your code,
                   and use comments to explain the purpose of your code.
- **Documentation**: Use [NumPy-style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for documenting your code.
